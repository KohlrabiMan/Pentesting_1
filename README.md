Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

> Objective: Find, analyze, recreate, and document **five vulnerabilities** affecting an old version of WordPress

## Pentesting Report

1. (Required) Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (WPVDB 7945)
  - [ ] Summary: The error occurs due to the truncation of the comment once the MYSQL TEXT type size limit is reached (64MB -64,000 characters). The truncation leads to malformed HTML being generated on the page. Then the attacker uses the HTML tags as the payload of their attack. 
    - Vulnerability types:XSS CWE-79 
    - Tested in version:3.9.3,4.1.1,4.1.2,4.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.1
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![error_404](https://github.com/KohlrabiMan/Pentesting_1/blob/master/pentesting1.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: I ran wpscan on the 4.2 version of word press. Then I chose the first listed vulnerability "unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)". Followed the links provided by the software. Found the proof of concept on https://klikki.fi/adv/wordpress2.html. Then using a character counter I generated the filler to exploit the truncation once I had over 64,000 (+64MB) characters, I commented it to to activate te XSS.

1. (Required) Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - [ ] Summary: A contributor or Author level account can insert specially formatted HTML containing JavaScript on a page or post. When the admin hovers their mouse over the link of the post the malicious script will be executed. 
    - Vulnerability types:XSS CWE-79
    - Tested in version:<=4.2.2
    - Fixed in version: 4.2.3
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough: ![error_404](https://github.com/KohlrabiMan/Pentesting_1/blob/master/pentesting2.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: Create a new post or page. Then in the text include the XSS script (e.g. "<a href="[caption code=">]</a><a title=" onmouseover=alert('test')  ">link</a>"). Make sure not to leave spaces or other special characters with in the alert prompt, else it may lead to a nonextant URL. Then publish the post (assuming of course you avoided the aforementioned issue). Go to view the post and hover your mouse over the post to trigger the script.
